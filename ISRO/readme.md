### [Guidelines for Participants](https://eclass.iirs.gov.in/assets/guidelines_for_participants.pdf)

## Attendance , read Guidelines Step 6
Simultaneous focus duration of browser is responsible for attendance.

Those who are facing attendance issue, 
- open the live season from E-class,
-  make it full screen (I preferred this way),
- don't do anything during this time. it may take 15-30 min to count your attendance. Officially 50% duration of total session time. 
- also I've noticed something,  if your attendance counted, there are some random messages sent from you on the Chat section(it could be prev. bugs).
  
- I still dont get why people put id on Question Asked(chat) section -_- .
